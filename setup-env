# setup-env - Sets up a bunch of standard environment variables in
#             preparation for a cross-compile of the kernel, modules,
#             or other code that needs to run on the ev3dev distro.
#
# You can override the variables here by creating a file either in the
# working directory (./local-env) or in your home directory (~/.ev3dev-env).
# If both files are present, the one in the working directory takes
# precedence.
#
# This file is normally source'd from within the actual build script using:
#
# . ./setup-env
